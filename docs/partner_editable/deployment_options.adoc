This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} at once: All features are enabled by default and will be installed.
* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} iteratively with fleature flippers: recommended if you only want to use certain features or you want to test the impact of particular features.

{partner-product-short-name} is currently best deployed into a new AWS account.
